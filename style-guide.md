# WebRTC coding style guide

## C++

WebRTC follows the [Chromium][chr-style] and [Google][goog-style] C++
style guides, unless an exception is listed below. In cases where they
conflict, the Chromium style guide trumps the Google style guide, and
the exceptions in this file trump them both.

### Exceptions

There are no exceptions yet. If and when exceptions are adopted,
they'll be listed here.
