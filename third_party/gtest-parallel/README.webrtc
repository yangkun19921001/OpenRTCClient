Description:
Parallelization script for gtest binaries.

Local Modifications:
Added gtest-parallel-wrapper.py to convert the GTEST_SHARD_INDEX and
GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS environment variables to flags, since gtest-parallel takes
flags as arguments, and delete them afterwards, since letting them set
introduces a bug where only tests in the first shard are executed.
